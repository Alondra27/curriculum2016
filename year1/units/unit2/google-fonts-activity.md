Google Fonts Activity (if you have time)
===

1. Go to [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
2. Find a font you really like. Here you can test drive fonts by double clicking on them and typing text in the boxes.
3. Click the red "+" sign to select the font you like the most.
4. Click the black popup notification bar on the bottom.
5. Copy the `<link>` element given under the "Embed Font" section.
6. Import into the Popcode editor inside the `<head>` element within the HTML section.
7. Use css `font-family` property to include your chosen font-family name (listed in the google font notification bar under "Specify in CSS").
8. Customize the page to be as cool as you'd like it to be, changing the font's color, size, and also the background color. Extra points if you include an image as well.
9. Share with a friend.

**BONUS**: you can copy multiple fonts if you want by clicking the red "+" sign on them, then copy+pasting the `link` over to Popcode.
