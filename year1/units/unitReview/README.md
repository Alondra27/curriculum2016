#Review Unit

In this unit the students are given a mid-year challenge in HackerRank. It will test all of the skills learned until this point. Teachers are then given the opportunity to have students create a project that requires the students to practice skills that require more attention before moving onto unit 8. Also included in this unit is a trivia lesson designed to review content before students take the mid-year challenge.
