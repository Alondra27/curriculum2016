#Unit: JavaScript Objects


##Scope
This unit will cover the basics of JavaScript objects. It will begin with a 45 minute lesson on objects and will then ask the students to create a project that incorporates what they have learned. The goal of this unit is to have the students become comfortable working with objects so that they can then work with API requests.

##Estimated Completion Time
This unit should take 120 minutes to complete. The project may take less or more time depending on students' needs.  

##Teacher Notes & Pro Tips
* It is encouraged that the teachers in the class complete this project beforehand to understand what issues the students might encounter.
* Students may or may not have an understanding of objects already. Practice makes perfect! 
* Task 4 can be extremely challenging! It is recommended to not spend more than one class on this project. Do not spend a lot of time ensuring all students complete task 4. A better use of the class's time would be to move onto the next project after all students have completed task 3.
