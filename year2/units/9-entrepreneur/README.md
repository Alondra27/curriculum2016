#Unit: Entrepreneurship Project

##Scope
In this session, students will work in pairs to create a project from scratch. This project is intended to highlight some very important aspects of being a quality engineer that include:

* Being a self-starter
* Working on a team
* Learning while creating
* Time management

##Estimated Completion Time
This project is designed to take between 8 and 10 sessions.

##Teacher Notes & Pro Tips
* Start small! Simple projects can become more detailed. Large projects often go unfinished.
* Structure each session with a do now, time to build and scrum.
* Require daily goals
* Students can begin to feel fatigue after this project stretches many weeks. Be aware of this and plan accordingly. Potential solutions to break up work time include: progress presentations or a day off from the project to do something fun.
